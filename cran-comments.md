## Maintainer

I, the maintainer of the `gips` package, legally changed the name in Poland, my home country. I used to be named Przemysław Chojecki. Now, my name is Adam Przemysław Chojecki. This is also why the old e-mail address <premysl.choj@gmail.com> was changed to <adam.prze.choj@gmail.com>. I am the owner of both of those e-mail addresses, and I still have access to those.
