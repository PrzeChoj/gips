This is a resubmission. In this version I have changed the following:

* Added reference paper to DESCRIPTION file.
* Uncommented examples. Change to \dontrun{} and \donttest{} accordingly.

## Test environments

GitHub Actions using `usethis::use_github_actions_check_standard()`

* MacOS-latest (release)
* Windows-latest (release)
* Ubuntu-latest (oldrel-1, release, devel)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

R CMD check succeeded

* This is the initial submission of this package to CRAN.
* This is my first submission of any package to CRAN.
* All exported functions document their return value.
* All exported functions documentations contain some runnable examples. We commented out examples of "print.*" functions so that those will not be printed on the console while testing.
