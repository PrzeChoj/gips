Description: Find the permutation symmetry group such that the covariance
    matrix of the given data is invariant under it.  Knowledge of such a
    permutation can drastically decrease the number of parameters needed
    to fit the model.  That means that with `gips`, it is possible to find
    a Gaussian model with more parameters than the number of observations.
    Sometimes, even if the number of observations is bigger than the
    number of parameters, the covariance matrix found with `gips` better
    approximates the actual covariance behind the data and is less
    variance.
