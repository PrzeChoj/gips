Description: Find the permutation symmetry group such that 
    the covariance matrix of the given data is invariant under it. 
    Knowledge of such a permutation can drastically decrease 
    the number of parameters needed to fit the model. 
    That means that with `gips`, it is possible to find 
    a Gaussian model with more parameters than the number 
    of observations. Sometimes, even if the number of observations 
    is bigger than the number of parameters, the covariance matrix 
    found with `gips` better approximates the actual covariance 
    behind the data.
