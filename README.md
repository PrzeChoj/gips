gips - Gaussian model Invariant by Permutation Symmetry

`gips` is an R package that allows finding the permutation symmetry group such that the variance of the data is invariant under it. Knowledge of such a permutation can drastically decrease the number of parameters needed to fit the model. That means it is possible to find the Gaussian model with more parameters than the number of observations with `gips`.
